# BootCamp

Summary:

We created a Machine Learning model that would predict GDP current in USD.
We used country data from the World Bank Data resources.
The Data included different ECONOMIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS,
that contributes in affecting the GDP.
ETL was performed and Visualizations were created using Tableau for the Case of Canada.

We Tried a couple of Machine Learning Models: such as Linear Regressor, Random Forest and Support Vector Regressor Model
But achieved best results with the Random Forest Model.

Below attached image shows the accuracy and the R2:82.6% achieved from the model:

GROUP WORK:
I personally contributed in keeping up the communication going, and helped myself and team members in idetifying problems, as it occured and found solutions in a timely manner.

Also, I worked on the Tableau Dashboard specifically,and provided presentation and insights to the group. We Used slack for our main communication hub.I think our strong point was that we connected and understood each one's speciality and allowed that team member to grow in that direction. Due to the nature of the course and the short timeline of the project, One will often feel, "This isn't enough" But my tip would be "do your best and leave the rest"
Take small breaks, allow to give your mind a tiny break "it deserves" and come back to the problem. Because with clear mind you can have a clear vision. 

Also, sometimes our ideas were very enthusiastic but when we wanted to implement we weren't able to. Due to the Data that we chose, "raw from the WORLD BANK" we were limited to what we have. Although it gave me a real life picture, for the project, one can may use a cleaner version of provided data, that will save time for your team.

Overall, my experience was phenomenal, I came with not even the basics of Data Analytics, but I feel confident, leaving out this room with so much that I have learnt across this short period of time. I AM A PRO! and I am quite glad about it. Last tip "stay open for learning! always!"
